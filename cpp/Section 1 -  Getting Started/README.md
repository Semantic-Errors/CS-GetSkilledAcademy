# Section 1 - Getting Started

## Section Learning Objectives

- Why Learning Programming and Why C++?
- Evolution of C++: `Classical C++`, `C++11`, `C++14`, `C++ 17`, `C++ 20`
- Who is this course for and Teaching Style?
- The main goals of the course
- How to tackle practices and homework
    - todo list approach for fully faliures, move on and back later
    - Serious trial (e.g 30 mins) and increase it later as you get better
    - Always checkout the solutions
- Simple C++ Program

## Curriculum Big Picture 
- **Programming Fundamentals**
    - Variables, Loops, Control Flow, Functions, Recursive Functions, Arrays (1D, 2D, ND)
- **Advanced Topics**
    - Pointers, STL, Templates, Headers, and Includes, Exception Handling, Compilation Process
- **Object Oriented Programming**
    - Objects, Classes, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Operator Overloading
    - Embedded in homework: Several design principles & patterns
- **Modern C++ 11/14/17**
    - Move Semantics, Perfect Forwarding, Variadic template, Folding expressions, Smart Pointers, Lambda Expressions, Wrappers (Optional, Variant, Any, Functional) and more
- **Extensive** set of quizzes, practices, and homework and projects


## Books Recommendation

NOTE: the course content will be comprehensive enough in most cases might not need to read the whole book
- **A First Book C++** (Classical C++) 
- **C++ How to Program** (C++14)
- **C++17 - The Complete Guide, Nicolai M. Josuttis** (Specific for C++17 - Covering only C++17 additions) 


To maximize my learning experience and gain a deeper understanding of the language I will read the following book and add notes and solutions to the chapter to the content of this course.

- [C++ How to Program 10th Edition]()
